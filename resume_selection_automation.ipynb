Usually our customers were\\ninterested in comparing their current sales with previous weeks sales to observe the trend. So we\\ncreated short summaries from a very large dataset of thousands of rows. We also did sentiment\\nanalysis of the comments they were receiving on their different products.\\nTools: Python, Langchain, OpenAI, Caprover\\nCustom Chatbot using LLMs\\nIn this project I have built a custom chat bot on a specific set of data. The clientâs requirement\\nwas to build a powerful GPT model using their data that can build the context and flow of\\nconversation using that data specifically. We used OpenAI GPT 3.5 to make this model\\nTools: Python, Langchain, Llamaindex, Tiktoken, OpenAI, OLLAMA, LLAMA.CPP\\nTarget Shooting app using OpenCV\\nIn this project, the bullet holes were detected on the white card board with circles used for target\\npracticing. We built an app to detect the scores depending upon the circle where the bullet is\\nshot. This project was completed using OpenCV and no deep learning or ML model was used.\\nTools: Python, OpenCV\\nObject Counting using YOLOv8\\nYOLOv8 object detection model was trained on custom data on a few objects to create an almost\\nperfect detection model. Deep SORT was used for object tracking and then a counting mechanism\\nwas implemented to count some of the objects placed in a certain area.\\nTools: Python, Ultralytics, Deep SORT\\nCVAT Data Annotation Pipeline Automation\\nIn this project I used an EC2 machine to fetch the data from S3 bucket. CVAT server was\\ndeployed on an EC2 machine for data annotations. Eventually, pipeline was automated to fetch\\nthe data in future using cron job and tasks were created on CVAT server for annotators.\\nTools: Python, AWS, S3, CVAT, EC2\\nModels Benchmarking Automation on AWS Device Farm\\nIn this project benchmarks of modelsâ inference times were generated using TF Lite benchmarking\\napp. We tested multiple models on the available devices on AWS Device Farm. Different\\nparameters were tweaked for the available delegates on a specific device to get inference times\\nfor a certain deep learning model.\\nTools: Python, ADB, AWS Device Farm\\nCrop disease detection using Deep Learning\\nThis is a mobile application made for farmers through which they can detect crop diseases using\\nimages of leaves. We built a system for two crops: Corn and Potato. The deep learning models\\nwere created using Keras. We deployed models on Heroku server using Rest API in Flask.\\nTools: Python, Keras, Heroku, Flask, Android Studio\\nIndoor Object Recognition for Robot Applications\\nThis is a computer vision based project which aims to build an indoor detection and recognition\\nsystem for mobile robot applications using deep learning techniques. We worked on the Open\\nImage Dataset and tested YOLO and some other deep learning models to see the results. As it\\nwas a real time application, so we used YOLO at\\nthe end for the final product.\\nTools: Python, Keras, Darknet, OpenCV, OpenNI, Pandas, NumPy\\nAnimal Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning\\nThis is an animal disease diagnostic system for the diagnosis in rural areas to facilitate farmers for\\nnot having enough facilities nearby. We tested a lot of machine learning algorithms and improved\\nthe system with the help of expert veterinary doctors.\\nTools: Java, Rapidminer, Weka, Matlab\\nVirtual Clothing Try-on\\nThis is a computer vision based project which aims to build a system where people can try the\\nclothes they want to buy, on the go. This saves a lot of time trying new clothes every time. The\\nproject involves Genetic adversarial network(GAN) based deep learning algorithms to tackle the\\nissue. We also had a dataset to test the system.\\nTools: Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch\\nFace Detection and Emotion Recognition\\nThe project aims to develop human face emotion detection. For this, the human faces are\\ndetected in images and then those faces are given to a deep learning trained model for emotion\\nrecognition.\\nTools: Python, Keras, OpenCV\\nTechnical Skills\\nJava, C, C++, Python, Matlab Scripting Language, Prolog, Haskell, Assembly Language(MIPS),\\nKeras, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Flask, NLTK, Spacy, Transformers,\\nPyfhel, Git, Rapidminer, Weka, Google Colab, Android Studio, Proteus, Latex, Scratch, Balsamiq\\nMockup, Anaconda, Spyder, PyCharm, IntelliJ, Eclipse, GitLab, Langchain\\nCertifications\\nâ Rapidminer Machine Learning Professional Certification\\nâ Computer Vision Workshop Certificate held at PIEAS',\n",
